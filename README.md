# Dilated Convolution Project

This project implements dilated convolution in C++ and explores optimization techniques. The goal is to demonstrate how dilation in convolution layers can affect the output and improve performance for specific tasks.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- CMake

## Building

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/dilated_convolution_project.git
   cd dilated_convolution_project
